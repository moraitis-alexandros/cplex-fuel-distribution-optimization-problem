# CPLEX Fuel Distribution Optimization Problem

## Overview  
This project develops a **mathematical formulation** and provides solutions for optimizing fuel distribution from a **single depot to multiple storage tanks**, focusing on efficient **time scheduling** for **loading, unloading, and delivery**.

## Problem Context  
In military operations, **fuel distribution** plays a critical role in sustaining logistical operations. The refueling process involves **transporting fuel from a port to multiple demand points (storage tanks) using a heterogeneous fleet of military vehicles**. Due to **operational risks**, tankers must leave the port **as soon as possible** to minimize exposure to threats.
